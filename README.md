# WhatsApp-AFK-Bot-Baileys-Version-
A simple AFK (Away From Keyboard) system for your WhatsApp bot built with Baileys. Users can mark themselves as AFK with /afk &lt;reason> â€” and the bot will automatically notify others who try to mention them. When they send a message again, their AFK status is cleared automatically.
